Assignment 1

Readme for deadline 1

All functionality for deadline 1 should be implemented in both parts 1 and 2.
The code was tested through the main function in part 1 and passing the equation 1-2+3 in part 2.
Both returned what was expected.
The only part where I am unsure is whether I was also supposed to implement unary subtraction for deadline 1.
The main thing I learned from this assignment so far is how similar using this type of coding is to discrete math.
