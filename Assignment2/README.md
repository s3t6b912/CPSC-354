Assignment 2
Sebastian Brumm

Deadline 1
I think I added the 4 correct lines of code. I would be more sure if I could test more complex lambda calculus equations but I'm still a little rough on it.
I tested it with (\ x . S x) S 0 and it definitely gives the correct answer.
It was hard trying to figure out what exactly evalCBN and subst were doing but I think I figured it out through testing and carefully reading the comments.
Please let me know if there was something I did incorrectly.

Deadline 2
Everything should be implemented, just not 100% just that ELet subst was implemented correctly with the id argument.
