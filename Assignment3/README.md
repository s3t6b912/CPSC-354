Assignment 2

For part one, it wasn't too difficult to translate the programs into the new language. The only complications were with the last function, insert sort, just because the way lists were built required different logic.
For part two, I had a lot more trouble with the insert and delete functions only because I forgot we were passing a POINTER as the input and not the actual list. This meant we could edit the list the pointer was pointing to without having to create a new list and worry about having the end pointing back on itself.
I am taking the OS class this semester so it was interesting to see the RR algorithm implemented using a circular list.
Otherwise, I didn't find this assignment to be super difficult like the last one and actually felt like I learned more about how linked lists and the RR algorithm works.
